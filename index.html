							<p>Some of the web development work I have completed for clients as well as projects I've worked on in the blockchain space from my Github. I am partiularly interested in the blockchain space currently for its' potential to empower the 
									individual and fundamentally change the way value is understood, exchanged and accrued online. Blockchains enable open accountable systems 
									from which new ways for large groups of people to collaborate and share resources will develop.</p>

							<p>I believe strongly that people from different backgrounds working together on a worthy mission have the best shot at 
								producing incredible results. To this end, I am always open to collaborate and build businesses that solve real 
								problems in our world. I function well as a CEO, CTO or CIO and can articulate complex visions into actionable 
								business processes. The brands I am a part of often view me as their linear problem solver. Even if we don't 
								work together professionally, if you are trying to make a difference in the world it would be my 
								honor to help in any way possible. </p>
							
							<h3>Skills</h3>
							
							<section>
								<strong>Web Development</strong>
								<p> 
								HTML, CSS, Javascript including React (I Like Next), Solidity, Some Rust, Some Python, Some PHP, API Integrations, SQL, Worked 
								with at least half a dozen databases, comfortable with every prototyping and no code tool such as Figma. I am comfortable using
								these skills where needed and develop others to creatively solve problems with an understanding of every stage of 
								project development. </p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<strong>Soft Skills</strong>
								<p> 
								I am comfortable working with and leading teams with differing incentives toward a common objective. I pride myself on being easy to
								understand and work with, but I am also clear and direct about the tasks that need to be accomplished. I have led rugby teams, adoption 
								floors and software integrated real world businesses and my philosophy has always been the same throughout: lead by example, meaning if I 
									am asked to lead a team I expect to be the hardest working member on it.</p>

							<h3>Facts About Me</h3>
							<p> 
								<ul>
									Speaker at the 2019 Humane Society International Conference on a panel regarding equity and equal opportunity for adoption for people of all backgrounds, as well as shelter and adoption floor best practices
									Have been blessed with the opportunity to help thousands of animals find homes as an adoption counselor, and I plan to return to the animal sheltering world as a volunteer, donor and more
									My work with J&B Solar over 3 years as their all inclusive web developer have taught me a bit about the solar industry's software needs, and I am very open to discussing more opportunities in this field
									The J&B Solar Website and job board have led to thousands of applicants and hires for J&B Solar, and they have moved all the way into the top 10 in Solar Power World's Top Solar Contractors during my time with the company
									I was adopted at 4 and spent the first years of my life homeless, which I feel contributes to my conviction toward social good and concern for cast aside pets
									My companies all contribute to the greater good in some way and always will, whether that be directly in their operations or through a portion of proceeeds going to good causes
									I plan to become SCUBA certified in the near future and enjoy nature photography as well as music production in my spare time
